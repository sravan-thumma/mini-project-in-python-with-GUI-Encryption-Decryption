# mini-project-in-python-with-GUI-Encryption-Decryption
This project is about the basic text encryption technique, Some module of this project is created by using ROT13-Algorithm. This Project Files contains both Standalone application and Command line interface.   
# Encryption
Encryption is a process that encodes a message or file so that it can be only be read by certain people.Encryption uses an algorithm to scramble, or encrypt, data and then uses a key for the receiving party to unscramble, or decrypt, the information.
# Decryption
Decryption is the process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text that you or the computer can read and understand.
# Description
The above python code is an not an standard nor an popular algorithm , It is purely designated by the host, And a particular module  of this code is written by using ROT-13 Algorithm which is popular but so what easy to crack this encrypted msg by checking possible combinations.
This Python code is developed both in command-line interface and GUI interface.

# Modules Used in Python Files:

playsound module - To play an sound file when program is Execute.</br>
If your machine is not configure to playsound module Follow the steps to install playsound module..: </br>
step 1: press windows+R </br>
step 2: type cmd </br>
step 3: type the command 'pip install playsound'. </br>
note : This pip works only when an python kernel is successfully configured in the machine. </br>
</br>
tkinter module - To Execute the GUI based application. </br>
this can be installed by follow the about steps with command 'pip install tkinter'. </br>
string module - To import the string methods into the code. </br>
collection module- To use the collections concept includes lists,tuples etc..

# ROT13 Algorithm 
The ROT13 cipher is a substitution cipher with a specific key where the letters of the alphabet are offset 13 places. I.e. all 'A's are replaced with 'N's, all 'B's are replaced with 'O's, and so on. It can also be thought of as a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.for refernce visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 .

# Procedure to Execute the files
We can using any kernel to execute these files where the machine must be configured by python kernel.</br>
list of Application which comes with python kernel :: </br>
1.pycharm</br>
2.python IDLE</br>
3.Syper etc..</br>
